The two pointer technique is a method where we use two variables (pointers) to move through an array or string instead of using nested loops.

One pointer usually starts from the beginning and the other from the end, or both move in the same direction.

By moving these two pointers intelligently, we can solve problems faster, often in O(n) time instead of O(nÂ²).

It is mostly used in:

Checking palindromes

Finding pairs with a target sum

Sliding window problems

Removing duplicates from sorted arrays
